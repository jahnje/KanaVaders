==========

Learn Some Kana - basically this is a Java 8 program that requires you  to type the romanji 
of the kana you see on the screen. The game starts up with a full screen screenshot of your desktop, 
so that you can play at work or at. you can then point it to a folder of images that will switch on each level. 
The game remebers where you left off, and will slowdown as you get to areas where you have problems. 

'`' = load random image(s) from image dir/ return to safe-mode image only
','/'.' = decrease/increase difficulty
esc = exit full screen
P = pause/resume
'-'/'=' = decrease/increase required correct
'1' toggle fullscreen
'2' toggle between hiragana and katakana
